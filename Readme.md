# Twitter Climate Change Sentiment Dataset

##### Human activities from pollution to overpopulation are driving up the earth's temperature and fundamentally changing the world around us. The rapid in-crease in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has warmed the planet at an alarming rate, bringing about consequences for our oceans, weather, food, and health. It is one of the greatest existential threats humanity will have to face in the coming decades.

##### Thus, in this project, I plan to tackle a sentiment analysis task that concerns the attitude of Twitter users towards man-made climate change. 
##### We look to uncover more about the perception of the climate change debate and the related beliefs through means and methods of web content mining.

##### The features include tweets pertaining to climate change dated between April 27, 2015 and February 21, 2018 as well as the respective tweet IDs.
##### All tweets were labelled by three independent reviewers and are part of one the following classes:
- -1: (Negative) the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change.
-  0: (Neutral) the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change.
-  1: (Positive) the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change.
-  2: (News) the tweet links to factual news about climate change.!
