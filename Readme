#Twitter Climate Change Sentiment Dataset

#####Human activities from pollution to overpopulation are driving up the earth's temperature and fundamentally changing the world around us. The rapid in-
crease in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has warmed the planet at an alarming rate, bringing about consequences for our oceans, weather, food, and
health. It is one of the greatest existential threats humanity will have to face in the coming decades.

#####Thus, in this project, I plan to tackle a sentiment analysis task that concerns the attitude of Twitter users towards man-made climate change. 
We look to uncover more about the perception of the climate change debate and the related beliefs through means and
methods of web content mining.
